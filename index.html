        <h1>WECLOME TO MY FIRST WEB PAGE</h1>


        <p>This is my first wepage that i have adapted from a free code 
           camp youtube video. I decided to change it and adapt so i can learn more. 
           I have made a webpage with the open university before, so know some of the syntax.
           So, this is a re-fresh for me, I hope to a on to the page as i become better with HTML. 
            
        </p>
        
        <h3>Life the universe and everything.</h3>

        <p>HTML is fun to use and i hope to become more advanced with CSS as well. <b></b>
           I have not used CSS before, but hopefully will get to grips with it in due time. 
           Learning how to use both mark up languages will obvously take time and the more 
           i use them the better i will become at web creation. But that is life. It takes 
           time to not only learn a skill, but to become at least half decent with it. I understand this. 
           Though, it can become vexing when you try to learn something and for some reason it feels like 
           you are not getting anywhere. I most deffintly felt like that when i had my cancer a few years 
           ago. Everything was going ahead and before long my body decided to give me a T2 Seminoma.
           Becuase of course it would! I had my real dad die a few years before so with this added 
           into the mix my head was all over the place which slowed me down a  lot. But, i kept going
           determind not to give in to how the universe wanted to take a massive dump on me all the Time.
           With that said, i think i'm a little crazy. The fact i just kept going and did my access course
           even though i had a cancer diagnoses says it all. Was i mad for doing that? absolutly i was. 
           My scores where terrible at that point with my chemo and operation to fight this, being taken 
           into account. But, i just kept on going forward after coming so far. I was at one point walking 
           to my maths lessons, then going work to do a twelve hour shift. At the time just after my real 
           dad dying i was working way to many hours for my own good.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Too many hours</h3>
        <p>Work at that point was making me drive a lot, it was for a lot of miles and a lot of hours. 
           the vexing part was i over did the hours and that bit me right in the bum. Burn out is a thing
           and can sneak up on someone without them noticing. Low blood pressure, light headed and the all 
           time and for some reason my joints felt heavy and i was walking through treackle. It took me 
           a year or so to kind of recover from that but even to this day it effects me. Not as bad,
           but it is still at times a little annoying when it kicks in. Working all the time is not healthy.
           It is even more annoying when it slowed me down. Right before i was about to buy a place my body gave in. 
           BOOM, hit me like a rock. Looking at it now, it was my own fault. I should not of over worked myself. 
           But i did, and it put me back by a year. Fell flat on the floor and back to square one. Think 
           i should of gone slower on that one. But none the less i kept at it and built up again and kept at it. 
           Building up slowy and making sure the skills and effective progresion is key. Far to often i've galavanted 
           off on some mission and burnt my self out. It was a pattern i did for years. I also listen more now and less 
           pig headed when it comes to people. 
            
        </p>


        <p>So i learned a few things and this is just a rough list:
            <br>just need to slow down in life.
            <br>Not take on too much. 
            <br>Over working is no fun.
            <br>I need to set small goals that go into a larger goal. 

        </p>

        <p> I am mostly learning from free code camp at this time and making steady progress. It is a lot of hard work. 
           But, i am getting there. I think, for the most part i am just focusing on getting my portfolio done. 
           Having a portfolio, will show the progression and level i am at. Which while is low at this time, i hope will increase in due course. 

        </p>
       
        <p>So, i hope in time i will get this skill more better and get much more advanced at it. 
            <abbr title="Time managment is important">time</abbr> , and if i can perfect my motivation and sense of dispiplin. 
            I hope that i can progress faster. Of course this is easier said than done. But, with motivation i hope 
            i can do this. The main issue is time. Time has a habbit of passing way too fast. Give it a few days and that can turn into a week. 
            Which can be annoying. And, working way too many hours is also a factor. You can only do so much in a one hour period. However, day by day 
            the hours will add up. 
        </p>

        <h2>Sometimes it can be hard to focus</h2>


        <P>It can be hard to focus, this is becuase there is so many options. One course has different things then others.
           It is hard to choose the correct one for you. Though, i found that, the best way to get around that is to just do it. 
           This has been proven again and again in life. Just do it, and then take it from there. It is not always that simple. 
           But, more often then not it is and life gets easier the more you understand this. Life will throw a curve ball.
           Everthing is goin ok, and than bam something will turn up to throw you out of sink. It might take a while to get back on the wagon. 
           It might be people, or a situation. But, it will easily throw your focus out. A few things popped up and distracted me recently. 
           Such as; Work, Cancer, and even family drama. But, if anything i am determined to get through problems that get in the way. 

        </P>
